# Data Architecture

## Purpose

blendCalc uses Supabase as the permanent source of truth for account data and the
canonical food catalog. Browser storage is not a second database.

## Read Flow

1. A protected route verifies the current user through `locals.getVerifiedUser()`.
2. Its `+page.server.ts` calls a focused server coordinator.
3. The coordinator starts independent Supabase reads together.
4. Shared query functions receive an explicit `{ supabase, userId }` context.
5. SvelteKit serializes the result into `page.data` before the UI renders.
6. Later user-triggered refreshes reuse those same query functions with the browser
   Supabase client and current session.

Fridge, Mix, and Saved follow this flow. They must not start their first durable-data
read from `onMount` or display a browser-storage mirror while Supabase is unavailable.

## Write Flow

Durable writes use narrowly scoped Supabase functions. The database function:

- derives ownership from `auth.uid()`;
- validates the current database state;
- handles conflicts and related changes atomically;
- returns a small typed outcome such as `saved`, `duplicate`, or `move-required`;
- prevents direct authenticated table writes from bypassing the rule.

Client checks may provide faster feedback, but they are never the final authority.

## Browser State

Browser storage is limited to data that can be discarded safely:

- an unfinished, account-scoped Mix draft;
- device-only preferences;
- short-lived session context for the currently loaded saved drink.

Fridge, Shopping List, custom foods, saved drinks, profiles, and canonical catalog data
must not be mirrored into local storage.

## External Sources

External food APIs are enrichment inputs, not live UI databases. Server code checks
blendCalc data first, requests only missing permitted fields, records field-level source
and license information, and stores accepted data in Supabase. Public/catalog reads do
not call external providers.

## Module Boundaries

- `src/routes/**/+page.server.ts`: route authentication handoff and thin load wiring.
- `src/lib/server/user-data`: page-level server coordination.
- `src/lib/utils/storage/supabase`: shared, typed Supabase reads and authoritative RPC
  adapters.
- `src/lib/utils/storage/client`: browser event coordination and temporary UI state.
- `src/routes/api`: small authenticated server boundaries for user-triggered writes that
  are not naturally submitted through a page action.
- `supabase/migrations`: constraints, policies, triggers, and authoritative write
  functions.

## Adding Durable Data

Before adding a new durable feature:

1. Design the normalized schema, indexes, constraints, and RLS.
2. Add one authoritative write path that derives the user from the session.
3. Add a shared query function that accepts an explicit server context.
4. Load initial route data on the server.
5. Keep only temporary drafts or device preferences in browser storage.
6. Test success, conflicts, missing data, permission boundaries, and database failure.
